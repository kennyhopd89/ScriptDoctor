## 💡 Quick Tips

### For Best AI Results:
- ✅ **Be specific** in director's notes: "Make dialogue more natural for teenagers" > "Improve dialogue"
- ✅ **Use diff view** before applying changes
- ✅ **Start with high-priority tasks** from Action Plan
- ✅ **Review AI suggestions** - don't auto-accept everything

### Common First-Time Mistakes:
- ❌ Uploading scanned PDFs (must be text-based)
- ❌ Not reading analysis before editing
- ❌ Applying all AI suggestions without review
- ❌ Forgetting to save after edits

### Time-Saving Shortcuts:
- Use **AI Auto-Fix** for quick improvements
- Use **Show, Don't Tell** for dialogue-heavy scenes
- **Scene Navigator** for quick jumps
- **Save frequently** (auto-save is on, but manual is safer)
